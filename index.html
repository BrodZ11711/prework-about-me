      <h1>Introduction</h1>
      <p>Welcome! I am a 21 year old male who has spent most of my working life as a tradie, however I've always wanted to get into programming and can't wait to see what the next chapter of my life will hold.</p>
      <h1>Where I'm From</h1>
      <p>I am from many places around the Mornington area, from Cranbourne to Carrum Downs, from Frankston to Karingal. I'm constantly on the move and who knows where i'll be in 6 months time.</p>
      <h1>What are your favorite hobbies?</h1>
      <p>My favourite hobbies have changed overtime, from loving to play basketball to developing a love for books, however, my latest hobbie (besides computer related stuff) has been miniture painting (such as Warhammer figures).</p>
      <h1>What's your dream job?</h1>
      <p>My dream job, like many others, has changed throughout my life, from wanting to be a professional video editor, to a music producer, from games programmer to games artist, however, although I'm not 100% sure what my dream job is EXACTLY, all my passed dreams have been computer related, and that's what my dream job will involve.</p>
      <h1>Where do you live?</h1>
      <p>Currently, I live in Cranbourne, Melbourne, Victoria.</p>
      <h1>Why do you want to be a web developer?</h1>
      <p>As I stated in my dream job section, I've always loved computers, from what they can create to what one person can achieve, I've spent a big portion of my life working not so ideal jobs just toppp make money to live, however, I want a job that i can be happy to work in, something I can be proud of, and something that I can come home and tell my kids just how happy and awesome working in this field has made me.</p>
